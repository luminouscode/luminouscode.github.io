    <h3>12)&nbsp;&nbsp;Leviathan - Scar Sighted</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="post_body">
    <p>Traditional rocking heavy metal that drips metal passion and swagger.  The incredible amount of memorable riffs and atmosphere recall the best of the proto heavy metal days of yore.</p>

    <h3>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstracter - Wound Empire</h3>

  <div class="post_meta">
    <h3>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Tribulation - The Children of the Night</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>Absolutely the catchiest, funniest, rip roaring metal album of the year.  Mixing everything from death metal, progressive rock, 70's dinosaur rock and a smidge of goth with gruff vocals.  Every single song slays and is hummable.
  </div>
  <div class="post_meta">
    <h3>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Chrch - Unanswered Hymns</h3>

    <h3>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;Ufomammut - Ecate</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>Monumental psychedelic ritualistic cosmicism sludge doom.  This is sludge doom metal taken to the level of religious ecstasy and communion via the riff.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="post_meta">
    <h3>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Chelsea Wolf - Abyss</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>Uniquely unbounded by musical genres and forms.  This album is an ominously dark yet fragile gem that engulfs you into Chelsea's twisted, murky dreams and stories.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="post_meta">
    <h3>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard - Noeth Ac Anoeth</h3>
    <p>Ethereal shoe gazing, murky doom.  Enchanting angelic vocals are juxtaposed against lumbering, organic, repetive doom riffs which fuel these massive, riff journeying songs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
  </div>
  <div class="post_meta">
    <h3>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother/Ghost - Buried</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>Hauntingly beautiful and intense with undertones of lanquid bliss. The album seemingly continues to grow in depth and intimacy on repeated listenings.</p>
