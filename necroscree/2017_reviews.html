    <h3>15)&nbsp;&nbsp;Xenotaph - <i>Media Morte in Vita Sumus</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
    Old school spikes and black metal attitude is served up with a healthy Baphomet headed amount of gusto.  For a debut album Xenotaph exudes the black metal swagger that normally only foundational bands of the genre take a few albums to acquire.  Songs blaze along propelled by the guitars which intertwine with icy melancholic melodies and forlorn counterparts.  Misanthropic, aggressive vocals belt out salutations to all that is unholy while tremolo-picked rapturous melodies flit about drawing the listener into Xenotaph’s ceremonial songs.

    <h3>14)&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit Adrift - <i>Curse of Conception</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Spirit Adrift bleed pure passionate heavy metal, influenced by greats such as Pentagram and Sabbath, however they are no mere hacks and have found their own unique metal sound on their sophomore album “Curse of Conception.”  Their sound is now the perfect blend of chugging doom and triumphant soaring layered riffs with quirky vocals that are endearing in their passionate delivery.  The future looks strong for heavy metal with Spirit Adrift and Khemmis taking the the metal mantle from past legends.

    <h3>13)&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumal - <i>The Lesser God</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Dumal on the “The Lesser God” channels ancient black metal from 1994-95 when the melodies where misanthropic and spirit of the forests were still frozen.  It is hard to believe Dumal hails from Pennsylvania, because they bleed Swedish black metal’s melodic sensibilities and sound.  Intricate repeating guitar melodies and ghastly shrieking are the foundation for every song.  May spring never come and the ancient melodies never die.

    <h3>12)&nbsp;&nbsp;Selbst - <i>Selbst</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Selbst the band and album have transmuted the typical black metal icy, coldness with warm hues and haunting tranquility.  However, Selbst have not defanged and neutered black metal, they rage with a black metal fury on songs like “Visions of Mankind Withering” or “Despised and Forgotten.”  Yet even at their fiercest the classy refinement in their songs, and I dare say old 70s hard rock influences, shine brilliantly.  For a debut Selbst have crafted an immaculate and moving album that soars with progressive melodies and atmosphere.

    <h3>11)&nbsp;&nbsp;Altarage - <i>Endinghent</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      “Endinghent” is an album full of alien and otherworldly dissonant, technical death metal.  The murky and cavernous death metal trappings that were present on Altarage’s previous album, “Nihil,” have been transmuted into mechanical chaos, with sinister angular riffing on “Endinghent.”  Besides the evolution in production quality, which is pristine and pure, the band have matured further in their technical prowess that now grants the songs a more tortured and alienating aspect to them.  Altarage have yet again birthed an ominously dark and foreboding album that this time oozes inhuman, sterile menace beyond just sounding like a monstrosity clamoring about in a cave.

    <h3>10)&nbsp;&nbsp;Dynfari - <i>The Four Doors of the Mind</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      I sure wasn’t expecting an existential black metal album based on a fantasy book which explores the mind’s ability to cope with pain.  Each of the four songs about the doors to the mind: sleep, forgetting, madness, and death are introduced with spoken word which can at times be profound or unintentionally awkward and funny.  Besides pushing the thematic boundaries on “The Four Doors of the Mind,” Dynfari also pushes their sonic pallet further to the blurred extremes.  The songs vary and flow from warmly hued black metal, emotive guitar atmospherics, crushing guitars, and at times soundscapes that verge on post-metal airy epicness.  Dynfari have evolved and emerged out of their early black metal Icelandic roots into an entity that has a truly special musical vision.

    <h3>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;Isenordal - <i>Shores of Mourning</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      The “Shores of Mourning” album is a sorrowful affair with somber but transcendentally soaring songs.  Cascadian black metal filtered through melancholic folk with a dash of early 1990s English doom characterizes Isenordal’s glorious sound.  However, it is the way Isenordal compose and craft their songs into a journey for the listener that breathes life into the typical grandiose black metal meets acoustic guitars with soaring violins cliche.  Also the incredibly sublime pairing of raspy black metal vocals with angelic vocals is another metal trope that has been overwrought with failure, but Isenordal again shine and conquer it with pure conviction and passion.  Honestly, not sure how much further Isenordal can advance their sound, but the “Shores of Mourning” the have released the genre defining album for Cascadian blackened folk doom.

    <h3>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;Almyrkvi - <i>Umbra</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Almyrkvi is yet another incredible black metal band to rise out of the fertile Icelandic scene. On “Umbra,” Almyrkvi deliver a mesmerizing mix of haunting melancholic black metal and glacially voluminous sonic soundscapes. The vocals also alternate between extremes with clean vocals transforming into roaring hellish growls as songs build and transmutate.  Thematically, “Umbra” delves into the cold vastness of space and the cosmos with tracks like “Stellar Winds of A Dying Star,” and “Forlorn Astral Ruins.” The music perfectly reflects the vastness and loneliness of space with melodic, grandiose black metal bleakness and overwhelming spacious doom.  “Umbra” is a hymn to black desolate void and the cosmically fertile possibilities.

      Utterly vile.  Primal.  A sonic abasement to the senses.  Caustic.

    <h3>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffering Hour - <i>In Passing Ascension</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Infectiously discordant, brutal and unhinged riff work is the backbone of the “In Passing Ascension” album.  Now couple the incredible guitar work with abrasive guttural vocals, that are actually understandable, and it provides a perfect blackened death oft-kilter album.  Even with the discordant riffage, the songs grow organically and twist and turn onto themselves in a very catchy, memorable, and fun manner.  A new age of brutal, technical death metal seems to be upon the metal community and Suffering Hour is leading the pack into a new brutal era.

    <h3>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Lluvia - <i>Enigma</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      When a corpse painted black metal dude shrieks in the forest does anybody hear him?  When a black metal band creates a musical masterpiece and nobody has a chance to listen to it, is it still a masterpiece?  At the edge of kvlt blackness lives Lord Vast of Lluvia.  He conceives incredible, eerie, atmospheric black metal that he doesn’t want anyone to listen to unless they have the purest of black souls.  “Engima” was released as a triple album box set with no song titles and limited to only 30 tapes. Even with the black metal elitism flying high, “Enigma” is one of the most mesmerizing, atmospheric, and trance inducing black metal albums to be crafted in the 2000s.  Every song is it’s own labyrinthine epic with eerie, ambient movements flowing into furious black metal that is desolate and haunting.  It is such a shame, an album with such amazing qualities and grandeur will never leave the trve klvt underground.

    <h3>4)&nbsp;&nbsp; N[]O - <i>Adrestia</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      N[]O is a Ukrainian black metal band with the worst band name in the world.  Is their name pronounced “NO” or “N bracket O” or is the “N and O silent?”  Who knows or cares, because they write brilliant music with every song and musical note on “Adrestia” which is dripping with raw passion and an emotive quality.  The band released this statement about the album, “Adrestia is the feeling of despair and hopeless anger at the world and humankind. Take on this despondent journey and join the losing fight against the world and the self.”  This perfectly summarizes the songs on the album, especially songs like “The Inferior” and “The Other,” with their raging, vicious and plaintive vocals, intricate black metal, powerful post-metal swirling synths, and biting lyrics.  N[]O have conceived a stunning and sublime album that is transcendent and introspective.

    <h3>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;Dvne - <i>Asheran</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      I totally adore the music underground, it keeps delivering incredible bands that flow from every corner of the world.  Before this year, Dvne was a totally unknown band to me and I only found out about them since they are playing at Psycho Fest.  Dvne come from Scotland, and have released two prior eps before this album.  With “Ashern,” Dvne have crafted a tour de force of sprawling stoner, progressive sludge that just bleeds with raw emotions and a passion that is undeniable.  Dvne assembles the progressive influences from Mastodon, Kylsea, and a wee bit of Neurosis, with a huge swathe of stoner, groove vibes.  The result is pure sonic bliss with a massive sound which is earth shattering spacious but nuanced, and delicate when it needs to be.  Dvne have conceived and encapsulated a stunning album with “Ashern” that verges on a timelessness quality.

    <h3>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;Swans - <i>Deliquescence</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Spellbinding, free flowing stream of consciousness music that ebbs and flows with the legendary Michael Gira orchestrating every nuance and climax.  “Deliquescence” is like a 1950’s revivalistic church ceremony that hypnotizes and scares a redemption of oneself.  Subsuming to the visceral power and journey of the songs is the main draw for all Swans music, but “Deliquescence” resonates and succeeds with an incredible performance by musicians at the top of their craft.  Always on the edge of musical ecstasy or falling into a chaotic quagmire, this album ends yet another brilliant chapter for the Swans.

    <h3>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell - <i>Hell</i> </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Horrifyingly heavy. Unnervingly heavy.  The ominous waves of claustrophobic doom induced dirges and vocal yowling is untouchable and chilling.  As wretched and dismally bleak, the soundscape forged contains super catchy riffs and songs that are incredibly hummable in an agonized but glorious manner.  Songs ooze and yon with a mindful determination to assault, pummel, and liquify the listener’s sense of reality and time.  Hell is beyond harrowing, immense, and immersive which pushes the doom genre boundaries.
