    <h3>25) Oxygen Destroyer&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Sinister Monstrosities Spawned by the Unfathomable
        Ignorance of Humankind</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Oxygen Destroyer taught me a new word: kaiju, which refers to the subgenre of Japanese giant monster movies, and
      also to
      the monsters themselves. This band is obsessed with kaiju. Oxygen Destroyer also taught me that they are an
      unrelenting
      black/thrash/death metal blitzkrieg that will make every attempt to tear your fucking head off when you press the
      play
      button. This album comes screaming from the sky (like a kaiju) at 1,000 miles per hour and never lets up for 29
      minutes
      of blinding, vitriolic hell. It’s a treat.

    <h3>24) Aylwin&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>The Arch Holder</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      One song, 30 minutes, pagan black metal glory achieved. Extremely Agallochian in
      style, but the result is still undeniably compelling.

    <h3>23) Càirdeas Fala&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Sons of the North</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Basically Saor if Andy Marshall were from Victoria, Australia instead of Scotland. In a very similar vein of
      folk-inflected black metal, yet distinct enough to not be a copy. The lo-fi production suits it while hearkening
      back to the iconic second wave of the genre, but what elevates it above hundreds of other releases for the year
      are the
      engaging and evocative riffs. There isn’t one track here that isn’t catchy in its own atmospheric way, giving
      pleasure
      across many repeated listens.

    <h3>22) 200 Stab Wounds&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Slave to the Scalpel</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      If you had told me ten, or even five, years ago that I’d love a guttural, verging-on-slam, death metal album this
      much,
      I’d have said you were batshit crazy. But I’ve had quite a death metal renaissance in the last couple years, and
      this
      young Ohio band absolutely fucking destroys. It’s some knuckledragger shit, but still has integrity, insane chops,
      and
      sounds amazing. Perfected brutality.

    <h3>21) Noltem&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Illusions in the Wake</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      I first stumbled into these Connecticut black metallers because the venerable Northern Silence Productions
      reissued
      their 2015 EP the following year, which was a nice boon for them. Six years later, they show they’re still a force
      worth
      recognizing. Brilliantly executed atmospheric black metal with solid pagan vibes.

    <h3>20) Dungeon Serpent&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>World of Sorrows</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      This release got some media attention but it was a total sleeper for me. Initially I thought it stood no chance of
      being
      on this list. Then, in going through the year’s releases, I heard it from another room so that I could not see
      what was
      playing from the massive playlist. Not yet being familiar enough with it, I found myself slack-jawed and
      proclaiming
      “What is this?! It’s fucking amazing!!!” It’s essentially Heartwork-era Carcass, but far filthier (ironic since
      Carcass
      themselves were about as filthy as you could get on their early work), with nods to the Gothenburg death metal
      style
      that itself was a scion of Heartwork. It’s as rumbling and devastating as it is melodic, but there’s no denying
      the
      melodies. An absolutely thrilling and inspired variation of the subgenre.

    <h3>19) Worm&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Foreverglade</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      One-man band that used to make weirdo black metal now makes weirdo doomy death metal. What makes it so great is
      that
      both genres shine through. And if you don't have your fill of weird, he throws some remarkably Steve Vai-like
      guitar
      solos into the mix on “Subaqueous Funeral.” Except Steve Vai would never title a song “Subaqueous Funeral.”
      Bizarre,
      delightful, and monstrously heavy, with creepy atmosphere for miles.

    <h3>18) Midwife&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Luminol</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Minimalist drone riffs and piano chords backed by airy, distant, synth-drenched vocals make for a haunting
      recording
      that’s more riveting than you might expect. Midwife (a.k.a. Madeline Johnston) was one of my great discoveries of
      the
      last couple years. She refers to her music as “heaven metal.” I’m not sure I know what that means, but I know I
      love
      this album.

      Three years and a pandemic have done nothing to slow these French melodic black
      metal maniacs. Spellbinding, anthemic rippers abound.

    <h3>16) Wheel&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Preserved in Time</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Classic doom metal with the emphasis on class. So pure and...well...classy, damnit. Lies somewhere between the
      European
      feel of Candlemass and newer US acts such as Pallbearer and Crypt Sermon. If that floats your doomed metallic
      boat, then
      enchantment awaits.

    <h3>15) Eremit&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Bearer of Many Names</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Absurdly heavy. Absurdly long too, with three songs taking up well more than an hour. By the gods, though, it is
      utterly
      crushing. Heavy for heavy’s sake isn’t enough, and initially I questioned whether it was worthy of inclusion here,
      but
      it somehow manages to remain compelling while it’s smothering you under approximately a trillion tons of concrete.
      The
      opener starts with a somber intro, morphs into straight black metal (!), does a Neurosis impression, and then
      apocalyptically concludes with DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM. Its journey from mere gloom to obsidian, opaque sludge is wild
      to
      behold, and the album only gets heavier from there. The unhinged vocal howls also play no small part in making it
      utterly hair-raising and terrifyingly effective. A menacing, horrific beast of a record that is sonically
      murderous.

    <h3>14) Ildaruni&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Beyond Unseen Gateways</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      From the unlikely location of Armenia comes this crazily talented band. Ildaruni play the best kind of
      folk-inflected
      melodic black metal – majestic, powerful, evocative. There are shades of modern Rotting Christ and classic
      Moonsorrow in
      it, and something satisfyingly late-’90s about it. Feels like some obscure Swedish band that would have blown my
      mind in
      ‘96 or ‘97, but instead is absolutely killing it in 2021. The folk elements, primarily flute, are what inject an
      eastern
      feel. The guitar melodies are perfect and drive every track with intensity, while the production is full, rich,
      and
      thunderous. An astonishing album.

    <h3>13) Noctule&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Wretched Abyss</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      We’re starting to see more and more women in metal, which is fantastic, and especially more of them in black
      metal,
      which is even better. Long a genre full of shitty incels, it was desperately in need of some female energy. Myrkur
      was
      one of the earlier examples, but sadly a piss-poor one. Now we have, among others, Hulder, Feminazgul (best band
      name
      ever) and this magnificent debut by Noctule, a.k.a Serena Cherry of Svalbard. Never really cared for Svalbard, but
      with
      Noctule, Ms. Cherry delivers a black metal record or pure wonderment. The tremolo melodies never stop sparkling
      and
      glimmering, and she brings a sense of almost palpable beauty to the affair. Much of it falls firmly in the
      post-black
      metal camp, with an unquestionable black metal basis but the use of major chords and uplifting melodies for a
      different
      spin. It’s completely hypnotic from start to finish, achieving levels of true greatness when it weaves in
      post-metal or
      even alternative rock. Dazzling stuff.

    <h3>12) Blackwater Holylight&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Silence/Motion</i></h3>
  </div>
  <div class="post_body">
    <p>
      Third time’s the charm, as the adage goes. I always liked this band but never loved them, and felt they had
      potential
      for more. Here they realize that potential. It is dreamier and more psychedelic than their prior records, yet also
      darker and heavier. Moreover, it conjures a massive atmosphere and a mysterious, ominous mood. Still a grower, but
      once
      the door opens and you start to understand what’s inside, it’s irresistible.

  <h3>11) Civerous&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Decrepit Flesh Relic</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    Of all the death metal albums that came out this year, this one resonated with me the most. It’s thoroughly
    devastating,
    and I love the echoey vocal style that sounds like it's reverberating off a dank cave wall. There are also plenty of
    “oughs!” to accentuate groovy breakdowns. More than anything, this record just seethes with menacing darkness. Lots
    of
    death metal albums aspire to do that, but Decrepit Flesh Relic genuinely makes good on it.

  <h3>10) Snake Mountain Revival&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Everything in Sight</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    Longtime stoner rock label Ripple has branched out with a second label called Rebel Waves, and put forth this
    release.
    It's a heady stew of soulful psych rock with beguiling twists (surf guitar!), some retro Sabbath stylings, and a
    super
    strong Black Angels vibe.
    There’s just a hint of gloomy 16 Horsepower Americana swagger too. Every song is great, and the title track is
    absolutely superb.

  <h3>9) The Flight of Sleipnir&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Eventide</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    It’s always a bewildering thing to see a band’s name around for years and years, never hear them, then realize when
    you
    DO hear them that you’ve been missing out the whole time. Finally The Flight of Sleipnir’s path has crossed mine,
    and I
    am stunned. It’s an interesting time to cross paths, too, as they’ve strayed from their doomy ways into what can be
    described as blackened, doomy post-metal, with a pleasant dose of folksy Americana. Genres aside, what matters is
    that
    the formula is incredibly successful. The emotional weight here is palpable.

  <h3>8) Doctor Smoke&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Dreamers and the Dead</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    Sometimes a band will make a significant departure from their previous sound, and once the initial shock wears off,
    it
    becomes apparent the change was not just for the better, but that they've hit upon something magical. Doctor Smoke
    have
    had a long time to make that change, with seven years having elapsed since their debut The Witching Hour. That album
    was
    very solid and enjoyable stoner doom, and Dreamers and the Dead finds them lightening their sound a bit. The
    trade-off
    is that they appear to have made a deal with the devil for insane hooks. The way these songs move and groove is a
    wonder
    to behold. Stylistically, they sound a whole lot like traditional heavy metallers Haunt now, but far fresher than
    that
    overly prolific band has been in years. There are shades of Cloak/Tribulation as well, two bands that are catchy in
    their own right. The amazing “Vexed” sounds like it was lifted straight from a Coheed and Cambria record. A highly
    addictive album that delivers a fix again and again.

  <h3>7) Blue Cheese&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Reborn Into Void</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    Top entry in the “weird-ass name, cool-ass album” category. Crumbling, blown-out, stoner fuzz with gritty vocals
    hewn
    from whisky and cigarettes. Sometimes burns bright with fiery blues riffs, sometimes smolders with glowing, buzzing
    embers of melancholy. Always rules.The opener sounds like Uncle Acid & the Deadbeats if they were to ditch their
    growing-ever-shittier production values and ape some Truckfighters riffs, and the heavy-as-fuck title track sneers
    through a dark haze. Stoner doom release of the year..

  <h3>6) Tardigrada&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Vom Bruch bis zur Freiheit</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    Wow, it does not seem like five years passed between Tardigrada’s previous album, the excellent Emotionale Ödnis,
    and
    this one. I was late to the party on the prior, so could not include it in that year’s list, and truthfully I didn’t
    do
    a deep dive into it for that very reason. How badly I missed out remains in question, but what is unquestionable is
    that
    this sophomore release is positively mind blowing. Traditionally performed atmospheric black metal just does not get
    much better than this. At its most breathtaking moments, the hypnotic melodies remind of Mgła in their prime. It has
    a
    more ethereal touch than that overall, but that’s a fitting comparison for the ecstasy-inducing “Trugschluss
    Vertraue”
    in particular. The atmospheric black metal realm is beyond saturated at this point, but this Swiss trio has dropped
    an
    entry into it that can contend with some of the best releases ever created there. Goosebump-inducing stuff for sure.

  <h3>5) Herzel&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Le Dernier Rempart</i>
  </h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>

    Heavy metal, thy name is Herzel. Around since 2013, but only now releasing their debut full-length, these Frenchmen
    have
    put forth the finest slab of classic metallic glory I’ve heard in several years. Part Thin Lizzy and part Iron
    Maiden,
    the air-raid-siren vocal highs fall firmly in the latter camp. Occasional moments of trilling, Gods Tower-style
    guitar
    add another layer of delight, as do folksy Celtic passages. This thing has riffs for days and the songwriting is
    superb.
    It’s like stumbling into some lost early ‘80s gem. If you don’t love this stuff, you don’t love metal.

  <h3>4) Sleep Moscow&nbsp;&nbsp;-<i>Of the Sun</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    Mix Swedish doom/psych band Witchcraft with Antony & the Johnsons and you'd more or less arrive at this utterly
    enchanting (also Swedish) band and album. Who ever heard of depressive psych rock? In a nutshell, that's what Sleep
    Moscow have achieved with this debut, and I could not stop spinning it. Achingly beautiful in its best moments.

  <h3>3) Mare Cognitum&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Solar Paroxysm</i>

</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    I had completely blown off this band and their boring “cosmic” black metal, but the inclusion of this album on
    someone
    else’s list made me take another shot. Much to my surprise, I was completely awestruck. Solar Paroxysm is nothing
    like
    its predecessors, except perhaps in subject matter. There’s no droning, murky, aimless nonsense here –it’s vivid,
    dripping with melodic ecstasy, and razor-sharp. This is the kind of grandiose, weighty, pagan black metal
    you would find on labels such as Bindrune or Eisenwald, with enough technicality thrown in to make the first
    Krallice
    record an apt reference as well. Utterly enthralling and on-point. I’ll look at this band’s future releases in a
    completely different way.

  <h3>2) Bríi&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>Sem Propósito</i></h3>

<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    Takes black metal into the future with a hefty dose of slow-building ambience and danceable electronics, but pulls
    it
    off impressively. Two songs, titled simply “A” and “B,” each exactly 28:12 long. When it really digs into the black
    metal passages, they swirl in a dazzling miasma of melodies that boggle the mind. The artistry and technicality on
    display here are matched only by the emotional power of it all. The individual behind the project is almost too
    prolific, releasing two other albums from two other projects in 2021 alone, but “Sem Propósito” is his most
    engrossing
    and impressive work.

  <h3>1) Alda&nbsp;&nbsp;- <i>A Distant Fire</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="post_body">
  <p>
    Alda's first release in six years. I very closely considered its predecessor, Passage, for that year's list, but
    there
    was always something about the production or the atmosphere that didn't sit right. I've no such complaints here,
    obviously. Some of that could be due to the fact that I saw them open for Panopticon several years ago and they blew
    me
    away, transforming my view of them. They do still make curious production choices, with the resulting sound being
    sort
    of dry, papery, and warm, but it works for them. What works even more is their impeccable sense of melody. Every
    track
    here delivers riffs and tremolo picking that are beyond reproach. Yes, a lot of it sounds like Agalloch because that
    is
    still largely Alda's stock in trade, but they're just so fucking good at it. More than that, rather than sounding
    like
    the umpteen-thousandth such black metal album ever made, it seems instead to honor those roots in a special way. A
    Distant Fire feels like a coalescence of all that is great, and all that I dearly love, about pagan black metal. It
    sounds timeless, ancient, pure, and perfectly authentic.
